This is a program to analyse temperature and injection dependent lifetime as measured
by quasi steady state photoconductance and photoluminescence. It requires some temperature and injection dependent models that are found in the semiconductor class that is in the  GitHub repository https://github.com/Shanoot/semiconductor.


To get this program to work, you need to copy the semiconductor repository into:
    ./analyser/
