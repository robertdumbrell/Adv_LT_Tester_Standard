    taken from the Couderc2014 paper
    depent on temperature

    This model different from proceeding ones by( taken
    from 10.1063/1.4867776):

    1. The model applies to all physically relevant
    regimes of dispersion comprising the whole interval
    from the Bose-Einstein limit Delta -> 0 up to sufficiently
    large magnitudes of the dispersion coefficient i.e., the
    experimentally relevant range of 0 < Delta < 3/4, at least!.

    2. The theoretical E(T) function should tend in the cryogenic
    region to a quadratic asymptote, i.e., E(0)
    [E(0) - E(T)] prop T^2 for T < Theta , in accordance with basic theoretical
    expectations as well as experimental observations.

    3. The new model should be suited for the construction of a
    practicable analytical expression that is capable of providing
    accurate self-consistent values for the
    dispersion-related parameters Theta and Delta.

    4. An important additional aim of the model is to be able to
    represent the final E(T) expression explicitly in terms of
    the model-independent parameters Theta and Delta, instead of
    requiring preliminary determinations of various model specific
    auxiliary quantities.
